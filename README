==========================
       Requirements
==========================

Windows: None

Linux: Python, wxPython

Ubuntu users need the following packages in order to have wxPython successfully
installed:

libwxbase2.8-0
libwxgtk2.8-0
python-wxversion
python-wxgtk2.8

wxPython is only required for using Keryx's interface. Project creation can be
done via command line parameters. See USAGE for more information.

==========================
Installation Instructions:
==========================

Extract the Keryx archive anywhere (typically a usb device).

==========================
          Usage:
==========================
Keryx is based around the concept of 'projects'. Each project keeps track of the
software versions that are installed on that computer. To get started you must
first create a project on that computer.

If you are unable to install wxPython but have Python installed you can still
create projects. In a console run:

'python keryx.py --create <project name> <plugin name>'

and Keryx will create a new project in the project directory. This is helpful
for Ubuntu server users along with users who have not installed wxPython yet.
The only <plugin name> currently available is debian.

Once you have created this project, make sure you have a copy on your usb device
that will be used to run Keryx from on a computer with highspeed internet.

Keryx can be run on ANY computer with Python and wxPython installed, meaning
Windows, Mac and Linux computers. Running Keryx on any Windows computer is
nothing more than running 'keryx.exe'. If you are running Keryx using Python, cd
to the directory and run 'python keryx.py' to start. Some environments support
running a python application by double clicking it as well.

After you have Keryx running on an internet connected host, downloading packages
is as simple as opening your project and selecting the packages to download.
Keryx will automatically select the package dependencies for you making sure
that nothing is left behind. Any packages you download are saved to your
project's folder in the 'packages' directory.

When you are finished you can return to your project computer and install the
packages through the usual way.

==========================
Uninstallation/Upgrading:

     Additional Notes:
==========================

Command line parameters:

-h or --help                            Displays this message
-v or --version                         Displays Keryx version number
--create <project name> <plugin name>   Creates a new project in the default
                                          directory with name of <project name>
                                          and type project <plugin name>
--config <file>                         Uses <file> to as configuration file

Due to py2exe's nature, information printed to the console is NOT displayed.
While the command line parameters will still work properly, no indication of
success will be shown in the console. The information will still be written in
the log files for further review.
